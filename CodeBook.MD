### Data Set Information
- The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
- Each person performed the following 6 activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist:
WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.
- Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
- The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
- The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into 2 sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
- The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
- The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
- The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
- From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration). 
- The estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A vector with time and frequency domain variables (561 attributes)
- Activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### 1. Merge the "training" and the "test" datasets to create one data set.
- Set the source directory for the files;
- Read into tables the data located in the following files:
    features.txt
    activity_labels.txt
    subject_train.txt
    x_train.txt
    y_train.txt
    subject_test.txt
    x_test.txt
    y_test.txt

- Assign column names 
- Merge to create one data set.

### 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Create a vector that contains TRUE values for the ID, mean and stdev columns and FALSE values for the others. 
- Subset this dataset to keep only the necessary columns.

### 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
- Merge data subset with the activityType table to include the descriptive activity names

### 4. Label the dataset with descriptive activity names.
- Use gsub function for pattern replacement to clean up the data labels.

### 5. Create a second dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
