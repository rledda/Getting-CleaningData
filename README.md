# Getting-CleaningData
Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Course project
Repository for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

##Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

##Project Summary
The script "run_analysis.R" that does the following:
1) Merges the "training" and the "test" sets to create one data set;
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Additional Information
Additional information about the variables, data and transformations are in the CodeBook.MD file.
