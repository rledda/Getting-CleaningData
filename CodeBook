##Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed the following 6 activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist:
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into 2 sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Attribute Information

For each record in the dataset it is provided:
Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
Its activity label.
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Part 1. Merge the "training" and the "test" datasets to create one data set.

1.1. Set the source directory for the files;
1. 2. Read into tables the data located in
    features.txt
    activity_labels.txt
    subject_train.txt
    x_train.txt
    y_train.txt
    subject_test.txt
    x_test.txt
    y_test.txt

1. 3. Assign column names 
1.4 Merge to create one data set.

Part 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

2.1 Create a vector that contains 
TRUE values for the ID, mean and stdev columns and 
FALSE values for the others. 
2.2 Subset this data to keep only the necessary columns.

Part 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

3.1 Merge data subset with the activityType table to include the descriptive activity names

Part 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
4.1 Use gsub function for pattern replacement to clean up the data labels.

Part 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Per the project instructions, we need to produce only a data set with the average of each veriable for each activity and subject
